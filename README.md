# SmartHarvest

Welcome to **SmartHarvest**! This project is part of our participation in the AI/ML Healthcare Hackathon. It's a proof-of-concept (POC) that showcases how machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) can be leveraged in precision farming. 

## Applications

SmartHarvest comprises three main applications:

1. **Crop Recommendation**
   - Users can input soil data to get predictions on the best crops to grow.

2. **Fertilizer Recommendation**
   - Users can provide soil data and the type of crop they are growing. The application will suggest necessary nutrient adjustments and recommend appropriate fertilizers.

3. **Plant Disease Prediction**
   - Users can upload an image of a diseased plant leaf. The application identifies the disease and provides information on its cause and prevention.

## Data Sources from Kaggle 📊

- **Crop Recommendation Dataset** (custom-built)
- **Fertilizer Suggestion Dataset** (custom-built)
- **Disease Detection Dataset**

### Crop Recommendation System
- Enter the nutrient values of your soil, state, and city.
- Ensure N-P-K values are the ratios between them.
- Use common city names for accurate weather data retrieval.

### Fertilizer Suggestion System
- Input the nutrient contents of your soil and the crop you want to grow.
- The algorithm will suggest nutrient adjustments and recommend fertilizers.

### Disease Detection System
- Upload an image of the plant leaf.
- The algorithm identifies the crop type, checks for diseases, and provides recommendations.

## Supported Crops

Currently, the system supports limited crop types.

## Usage ⚙️

Feel free to develop further and add your work to this project. Please credit the original source and include the link to this repo in your reports.

## Further Improvements 📈

- Improve the CSS code for better structure.
- Enhance the frontend design.
- Collect more data via web scraping for accuracy.
- Gather additional plant images to enhance disease detection robustness.
- Write modularized code instead of Jupyter Notebooks.
